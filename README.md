![RAM CPU Usage sample](sample.png "RAM CPU Usage sample")

To build, use `build.bat` , then use `golang_ram_cpu_info.exe` for headless tray icon app, or use `golang_ram_cpu_info__console.exe` if you'd like to see some console output as well.

If available, [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) is used to compress the .exe files.
